                As part of my Berkeley summer fieldwork requirement, I worked with with Ninth Root, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit. The internship asked how civic design tools could protect Black land stewardship when development pressures and ecological harm collide.

            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>
                In the summer of 24, I completed an Urban Planning Internship with Ninth Root, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit. I worked alongside community organizers and residents to design listening sessions that addressed land use, displacement, and ecological care. This project investigated how civic design tools—such as systems mapping, co-creation workshops, and storytelling—could strengthen community agency in environmental planning and stewardship.
            </p>

            <h3>Key contributions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Listening Sessions:</strong> Designed and facilitated sessions centering intergenerational narratives around environmental harm, healing, and land justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Civic Design Strategy:</strong> Mapped relationships between community assets, governance structures, and environmental inequities to inform participatory planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Workshop Design:</strong> Co-created creative engagements that merged art, policy dialogue, and local activism to translate residents’ stories into actionable frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Training &amp; Visual Tools:</strong> Produced volunteer recruitment materials, facilitation guides, and visual systems maps to support Ninth Root’s ongoing initiatives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ongoing scholarship</h3>
            <p>
                This fieldwork informs my forthcoming chapter on Black Ecofeminisms and Land Stewardship in <em>Indigenous Sovereignty in Environmental Research: Decolonizing Ethics and Methodologies</em> (Routledge, forthcoming). The chapter extends this applied design work, positioning stewardship as both a civic design practice and a framework of care within environmental and technological systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Turned community listening into civic intelligence—translating lived experiences into design artifacts that guide equitable environmental planning and future coalition-building.
