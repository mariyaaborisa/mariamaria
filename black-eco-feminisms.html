            <h2>Project context</h2>
            <p>
                Environmental justice conversations are often dominated by metrics devoid of lived experience. Black women organizers asked us for a tool that preserves narrative agency while equipping them with credible evidence for grant proposals and council meetings.
            </p>

            <h2>Core themes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interdependence.</strong> Visualizing how housing, health, and ecology intersect block-by-block.</li>
                <li><strong>Reparative storytelling.</strong> Pairing satellite change detection with oral histories to highlight resilience strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-determination.</strong> Providing communities direct control over data redaction and access permissions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Research &amp; findings</h2>
            <p>
                We co-designed qualitative coding rubrics with organizers, then developed a Deck.gl layer system that overlays particulate matter spikes with interview excerpts. Policy teams used the platform to argue for funding targeted tree canopies and respiratory clinics.

            <h2>Lessons forward</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Building a federated publishing workflow so partner organizations can host localized versions offline.</li>
                <li>Expanding to include audio narratives with Web Captioner transcripts for accessibility.</li>

            <p>
                As part of my UC Berkeley summer fieldwork and Arcus Social Justice Fellowship, I completed an Urban Planning Internship with Ninth Root, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit. I worked alongside community organizers and residents to design listening sessions that addressed land use, displacement, and ecological care. This project investigated how civic design tools—such as systems mapping, co-creation workshops, and storytelling—could strengthen community agency in environmental planning and stewardship.
            </p>

            <h3>Key contributions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Listening Sessions:</strong> Designed and facilitated sessions centering intergenerational narratives around environmental harm, healing, and land justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Civic Design Strategy:</strong> Mapped relationships between community assets, governance structures, and environmental inequities to inform participatory planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Workshop Design:</strong> Co-created creative engagements that merged art, policy dialogue, and local activism to translate residents’ stories into actionable frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Training &amp; Visual Tools:</strong> Produced volunteer recruitment materials, facilitation guides, and visual systems maps to support Ninth Root’s ongoing initiatives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ongoing scholarship</h3>
            <p>
                This fieldwork informs my forthcoming chapter on Black Ecofeminisms and Land Stewardship in <em>Indigenous Sovereignty in Environmental Research: Decolonizing Ethics and Methodologies</em> (Routledge, forthcoming). The chapter extends this applied design work, positioning stewardship as both a civic design practice and a framework of care within environmental and technological systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Turned community listening into civic intelligence—translating lived experiences into design artifacts that guide equitable environmental planning and future coalition-building.
