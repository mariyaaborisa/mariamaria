                    I'm a childhood rights activist, researcher, and technologist working at the intersection of AI safety, digital rights, and environmental justice. I build frameworks that treat childhood as critical infrastructure, requiring the same proactive protection we give to watersheds, power grids, and transportation systems.

                <h2>My Path</h2>
            <p>
                I didn't start here. I started as a K-12 educator witnessing how educational disparities shape children's futures. I saw kids with incredible potential locked out of opportunities by systems designed without them in mind. I wanted to scale solutions, to build tools that could reach more children.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when I tried, I was told I wasn't "technical enough."
            </p>
            <p>
                So I went to business school. I earned a Master of Innovation & Entrepreneurship at UC Irvine, learned to speak the language of startups and venture capital, understood business models and growth strategies. I thought that would be enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even after business school, I was called outright the "non-technical founder." My business acumen was not enough. The goalposts kept moving. I watched less qualified people get funded, get taken seriously, get opportunities, while I was told to find a "technical co-founder" who could do the "real work."
            </p>
            <p>
                Frustrated and abandoned by the startup process, I took the critique to UC Berkeley. I earned a Master of Design in HCI & New Media, learning to build the technologies I'd been told I couldn't. I developed AI-powered learning tools. I created interactive exhibits. I worked with engineering teams. I became the technical person they said I needed to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                But something shifted during that journey.
            </p>

            <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
            <p>
                Training at UC Berkeley's Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity opened my eyes to how technology could be used for safety and trust, not just growth and profit. As an Arcus Social Justice Fellow investigating environmental design issues, I began seeing how digital and ecological systems mirror each other. How the same communities facing environmental destruction are targeted by exploitative algorithms. How the harms collapse onto the same vulnerable populations.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then it became personal.
            </p>
            <p>
                My son fell victim to a scam on Discord. He had bypassed our family safety conversations, and the incident shattered the trust we'd built around digital spaces. As a cybersecurity researcher, I could support him through what happened. As a parent and educator, we had necessary conversations about trust, both between us and with the platforms we use. But as a user, I wanted more from Discord.
            </p>
            <p>
                The remediation options were limited. My son no longer uses the platform. We lost what had been a positive space for him because the harm couldn't be adequately addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                That loss clarified everything.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Work Matters</h2>
            <p>
                These platforms aren't just apps. They're infrastructure shaping how children learn to navigate community, trust, and risk. When safety failures occur, we don't just lose individual users. We lose families' willingness to see these spaces as safe for their children.
            </p>
            <p>
                And this isn't separate from environmental justice. The communities most vulnerable to algorithmic harms (Black, Latina, Indigenous, immigrant, low-income communities) are often the same ones facing environmental destruction. Digital exploitation and ecological violence are parallel systems of oppression, and children bear the brunt of both.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became a childhood rights activist because I refuse to accept that these harms are inevitable. Children have rights to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Safe digital environments that support their development, not exploitation machines designed to maximize engagement</li>
                <li>Livable environmental futures, not the climate catastrophe we're handing them</li>
                <li>Community protection across both domains, because these threats are interconnected</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Childhood is critical infrastructure. It requires the same intentional stewardship we give to water systems, soil health, and biodiversity. The children learning to navigate these intersecting threats today will be the adults designing our digital, civic, and ecological infrastructure tomorrow.
            </p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>
                I build AI systems, conduct digital threat investigations, and develop policy frameworks, all centered on protecting children's rights. I've built AI-powered learning tools for elementary students, applying prompt engineering and pedagogical design to create safe, engaging experiences. I've developed interactive exhibits using natural language models. I work with organizations serving vulnerable communities to develop operational policies, digital communication strategies, and trauma-informed UX support.
            </p>
            <p>
                I utilize threat intelligence and OSINT methodologies to expose violations of children's rights in digital spaces. I apply spatial analysis to understand how environmental and digital vulnerabilities overlap. I work across languages and cultures, building frameworks that work for communities often left out of "innovation."
            </p>
            <p>
                Through CyberCare Collective, I'm building community-centered approaches to children's digital and environmental rights. Through research and organizing, I'm developing frameworks that connect how we protect children across domains.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work is informed by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two master's degrees (UC Berkeley Design, UC Irvine Innovation & Entrepreneurship)</li>
                <li>Training in cybersecurity (UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity)</li>
                <li>Research in environmental justice (Arcus Social Justice Fellow)</li>
                <li>Six years as K-12 educator (understanding how children actually develop and learn)</li>
                <li>Founder experience (built and scaled an education-technology organization)</li>
                <li>Lived experience as a Black Latina mother navigating these systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I'm bilingual (English/Spanish), and I bring both technical expertise and deep understanding of the communities most impacted by the harms I'm working to address.
            </p>

            <h2>What I'm Building Toward</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not interested in making harmful systems slightly less harmful. I'm interested in building new frameworks that center children's rights from the start. Frameworks that recognize digital and environmental justice as interconnected. Frameworks that work across cultures and contexts. Frameworks that build community power, not just individual protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is 15-20 year work. Maybe longer. I'm building toward a world where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Children's rights are centered in technology design, not afterthoughts</li>
                <li>Communities have power to protect their children across digital and environmental domains</li>
                <li>The next generation inherits systems designed for their flourishing, not their exploitation</li>
                <li>We treat childhood with the seriousness it deserves as the foundation of everything that comes after</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If this resonates with you, if you're working on similar issues, building in adjacent spaces, or want to collaborate, I want to hear from you.
