            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>
                I am a childhood rights activist, educator, and advocate working at the intersection of digital safety, environmental justice, and community empowerment. As a Black Latina mother and bilingual educator (English/Spanish), I bring lived experience and frontline knowledge to my work protecting young people in digital spaces.
            </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I spent six years as a K-12 educator, witnessing firsthand the challenges children face navigating technology without adequate protections. This experience led me to pursue advanced studies in innovation and human-centered design:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Master of Innovation & Entrepreneurship</strong> – UC Irvine</li>
                <li><strong>Master of Design in Human-Computer Interaction & New Media</strong> – UC Berkeley</li>
                <li><strong>Cybersecurity Training</strong> – UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As an Arcus Social Justice Fellow, I've worked to translate critical scholarship into actionable frameworks that communities can use to protect themselves and advocate for systemic change.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                My advocacy is deeply personal. When my son fell victim to a Discord scam, I realized that even the most vigilant parents struggle to protect their children from predatory platforms designed to extract data and attention. This experience catalyzed my commitment to building tools and frameworks that center children's safety, dignity, and autonomy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I founded the <strong>CyberCare Collective</strong> to address these gaps—creating resources and advocacy pathways for families, educators, and policymakers working to make digital spaces safer for children.
            </p>

            <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI Safety & Digital Rights:</strong> Advocating for ethical AI governance, particularly in education and youth-facing technologies</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Justice:</strong> Connecting digital equity to climate justice and sustainable community development</li>
                <li><strong>Community-Centered Design:</strong> Building participatory frameworks that amplify marginalized voices in technology policy</li>
            </ul>
