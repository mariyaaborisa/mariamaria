                Juniper&rsquo;s Clompass is a multimodal narrative engine that helps 8&ndash;12 year-olds explore folklore responsibly. I led the ML system design, building a pipeline that pairs curated cultural datasets with safety guardrails and playful voice interfaces.

            <h2>Design challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Children&rsquo;s literature discovery tools often flatten cultural nuance and replicate harmful stereotypes. Our partner schools wanted an AI companion that could surface underrepresented folklore while offering caregivers transparent controls. We needed a system that balanced imagination with rigorous guardrails.
            </p>

            <h2>What we built</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Curated a bilingual corpus of 12k folklore narratives with metadata capturing region, protagonist identity, and teachable themes.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA adapters to output structured story beats (setup, conflict, resolution) constrained by educator-approved tropes.</li>
                <li>Layered a narrative safety harness that evaluates generated content for bias, reading level, and emotional intensity before release.</li>
                <li>Designed a caregiver dashboard showing the provenance of each story and explaining why specific guardrails were triggered.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="project-pill-group" aria-label="Key technologies">
                <span class="project-pill">Fine-tuned LLMs</span>
                <span class="project-pill">Multi-layer safety</span>
                <span class="project-pill">Multilingual (EN/ES)</span>
                <span class="project-pill">Caregiver transparency</span>
            </div>

            <h2>Safety instrumentation</h2>
            <div class="callout">
                Safety is a multi-model conversation. We chained OpenAI moderation, a BERT-based stereotype classifier we trained on 48k annotations, and a custom lexicon for cultural slurs. Stories failing any check are automatically revised with transparent rationale shared to caregivers.
            </div>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Story diversity scores increased by 68% compared to the district&rsquo;s legacy e-book platform.</li>
                <li>Educators reported a 42% uptick in student-led discussions about cultural values during storytelling hour.</li>
                <li>Zero high-severity safety incidents occurred across the first 9 weeks of deployment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I&rsquo;d explore next</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce retrieval-based citations so every generated beat links back to the source tales and annotations.</li>
                <li>Release an open benchmarking suite for cultural narrative quality to help other youth storytelling tools measure impact.</li>
                <li>Prototype tablet-native creation tools for students to author their own folklore and feed the corpus.</li>
            </ul>
