            <h2>Project Vision</h2>
            <p>
                ReBrew creates a playful, simple, and sustainable way for beginners to discover herbalism. We reimagined the entire lifecycle—from how we collect herbs, process ingredients, consume nutrients, and dispose of waste—to care for the health of ourselves and others.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Based on symptoms, users flip to the recipe they need, tear out a piece of recipe paper, and follow instructions to dissolve it in water. Each preparation method serves different healing purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Throat Coat Tea</strong> – Steeped in hot water for soothing relief</li>
                <li><strong>Warming Broth</strong> – Boiled for nourishing warmth</li>
                <li><strong>Steam Inhalation</strong> – Vaporized to clear respiratory passages</li>
                <li><strong>Poultice for Wounds</strong> – Plunged in water for topical healing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Zero-Waste Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                After use, the remains can be poured down the drain or added to garden soil as fertilizer. The dissolvable paper is fully biodegradable, and pre-measured portions eliminate herb waste. Every element of ReBrew considers environmental impact without compromising efficacy.
            </p>

            <h2>Material Research</h2>
            <p>
                We developed a proprietary organic paper formula that dissolves completely while preserving the medicinal properties of traditional herbs. The paper acts as both carrier and ingredient, creating a seamless integration of form and function.
            </p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Makes traditional herbalism accessible to beginners through guided, pre-measured formats</li>
                <li>Eliminates packaging waste through biodegradable, compostable materials</li>
                <li>Preserves traditional medicine knowledge in contemporary, user-friendly form</li>
                <li>Creates a closed-loop system where all byproducts return to the earth</li>
            </ul>
